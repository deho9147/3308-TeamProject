## Description
Simulate the use of a mech in virtual reality using the availible motion controls. Create a destructable enviroment to use the mech. Be able to fight other mechs in this enviroment. 
## Vision
Be a giant mech and fight shit

## Motivation
We want to learn more about VR and explore the tools availible for developing games in VR. 

## Risks
VR means we have limited experience and the hardware is complicated.
We only have access to one VR kit which means testing may be a challenege.
Finding or creating assets will be a challenge.
## Mitigation Strategy

Try to find times where we can get together and all have access to the VR kit.
By being together we can also learn from each other on how the hardware for
VR works.
