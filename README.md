## Description
Simulate the use of a mech in virtual reality using the availible motion controls. Create a destructable enviroment to use the mech. Be able to fight other mechs in this enviroment.

## Repository Organization
The Assets folder contains all scripts, prefabs, sprites, textures, toolkits, etc... The contents of the Materials, Scenes, Scripts, Textures, and UI folders were created by us. Most other assets are imported from the Unity Asset Store.

Documentation can be found in the Doc directory. Documentation relies on Doxygen. The provided Doxyfile should document only the code written by this project.

## Building
The repository must be imported into the Unity editor. From there it can be built as a typical Unity game for Windows, OSX, or Linux. (Note, the project requires a VR headset and controllers; preferrably the HTC Vive)
